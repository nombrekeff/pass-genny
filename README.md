## Challenge description

Make a password generator **Design + Code** in 2 days or less.

### Design
Design was made in 4-6h in Figma, did not track the time very well.

You can check the Figma file [here](https://www.figma.com/file/UqKfdepVu3H9cD9EYRuNNJ/pass-genny?node-id=0%3A1)

### Code
Code related stuff was done in around 4h, code + setting up repo, deploying to vercel.

### Tech

* [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), + [svelte-routing](https://github.com/EmilTholin/svelte-routing)

Otherwise everyting else is done by me :)
